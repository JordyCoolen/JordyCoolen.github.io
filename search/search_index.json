Validated with 150/151 bp paired-end reads. Scientific paper: \u00b6 Coolen, J. P., Wolters, F., Tostmann, A., van Groningen, L. F., Bleeker-Rovers, C. P., Tan, E. C., ... & Melchers, W. J. (2021). SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing using reverse complement PCR: For easy, fast and accurate outbreak and variant analysis.

It is able to identify species of TB/nTM from positive MGIT cultures. To do so it uses a hsp65 database for fast identification coupled with a Metagenomic method using centrifuge to identify on genome level. For TB it also is able to identify subspecies. Results are presented in automated pdf and html reports. Scientific paper: \u00b6 Schildkraut JA, Coolen JPM, Severin H, Koenraad E, Aalders N, Melchers WJG, Hoefsloot W, Wertheim HFL, van Ingen J.
