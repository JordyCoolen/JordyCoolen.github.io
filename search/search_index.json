It is able to identify species of TB/nTM from positive MGIT cultures. To do so it uses a hsp65 database for fast identification coupled with a Metagenomic method using centrifuge to identify on genome level. For TB it also is able to identify subspecies. Results are presented in automated pdf and html reports.
